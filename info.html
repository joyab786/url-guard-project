        <h1>Understanding Digital Threats</h1>
        <p class="intro">In today's digital world, being aware of online threats is crucial. Let's learn about two common dangers: Phishing and Hacking.</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>üé£ What is Phishing?</h2>
            <p><strong>Phishing</strong> is a type of scam where attackers disguise themselves as a trustworthy person or company to trick you into giving them sensitive information. Think of it like a fisherman using bait (a fake email or message) to catch a fish (you).</p>
            <p>Their goal is to steal things like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Usernames and passwords</li>
                <li>Credit card numbers</li>
                <li>Bank account details</li>
                <li>Personal identification information</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>üßê How to Spot a Phishing Attack</h2>
            <p>Look for these common red flags:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Sense of Urgency:</strong> Messages that say "Your account will be suspended!" or "Urgent action required!"</li>
                <li><strong>Generic Greetings:</strong> Emails that start with "Dear Customer" instead of your name.</li>
                <li><strong>Suspicious Links:</strong> Hover your mouse over a link (don't click!) to see the actual web address. If it looks strange, it's likely a phishing attempt.</li>
                <li><strong>Bad Grammar and Spelling:</strong> Professional companies usually don't send emails with obvious mistakes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>üíª What is Hacking?</h2>
            <p><strong>Hacking</strong> is the act of gaining unauthorized access to a computer system or network. While it can be used for good (ethical hacking), it's most often associated with criminal activity to steal data, install malware, or spy on your activity.</p>
